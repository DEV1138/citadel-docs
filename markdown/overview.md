## Citadel

Using *Citadel* is a bit different from other operating systems. Please take
some time to read through this documentation to understand how things work.
Overall, the system is composed of three parts:

- [Citadel](citadel/index.html)
- [Application Images](appimgs/index.html)
- [Realms](realms/index.html)

Many aspects are under heavy development and changing rapidly. Feel free to
engage with us:

- Via our [issue tracker](https://github.com/subgraph/citadel/issues)
- On IRC in `#subgraph` on the `irc.oftc.net` network
