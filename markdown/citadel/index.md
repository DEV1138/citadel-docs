# Citadel

At the core of your system is the hyponymously named `Citadel`, which the most
minimal and central piece to everything. Citadel contains only the base OS
files and the Gnome desktop but does not include any graphical applications.

To install and run applications Citadel creates spaces called
[Realms](realms/index.html) which are based on top of an [Application
Image](appimgs/index.html). You can have multiples of both of these, but you can
only have one Citadel.
